# Operational-Management
In this course we will focus on the operational decisions of a firmâ€”the ones directly related to
manufacturing of products and provision of services. We will see how such decisions should be
made optimally, how they affect the financial performance and how they align with the strategic
goals of the firm. The objective of this course is to provide you with both qualitative insights and
quantitative modeling tools that are helpful in analyzing operational decisions.
Among the way, we will take a closer look at how companies such as Zara, Dell, and Barilla used
the ideas from operations management to their advantage. We will start by exploring how a
company should allocate its resources to ensure productive efficiency. Next, we will consider
uncertainty: how it can be estimated and how it affects optimal decision-making. Finally, we will
consider the issues of decision sequencing and supply chain coordination.
